## Project goals

Prior to developing Horizons, I had 3 major goals in mind that I wanted to achieve with creating this application:
- I wanted to create a sense of community within a particular niche, whereby the content and data provided, as well as the inputted data from the user, were all based around the same theme and community.
- I also wanted to add categorisation to the content in which users were creating - this would make it easier for other users to engage with content that was relevent to them, and it also enables them to filter out any content that they choose not to engage with.
- I wanted to give the user a sense of individuality within their own profile - whereby they could add user-specific information that is strictly relevent to themselves yet allows other users to retrieve and engage with this.
- Finally, I want an 'admin role' to have important within my application, whereby admins can act as mediators to ensure that content which is being shared it relevent and appropiate. These admin users will have the ability to not only retrieve other user's content, but they will also have the ability to destroy another user's content if it is in the best interest of protecting the community.
